## About Trax

Think [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com) or [Imdb](http://imdb.com), but for music.
Discover others who share your taste in music, get recommendations, suggest awesome music for your friends, hold discussions about your favourite artistes and genres, all on TRAX.
This is an ongoing project, and I currently have no feasible launch date.
